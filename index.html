        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business-Real Estate</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Stefano Cardona, I was born in Puerto Rico and moved to Los Angeles at the age of 3 years old. I grew up in a single parent household with my mom being the head of the house. Although it’s considered to be an unfortunate circumstance to only live with one parent, I believe this has made me stronger as an individual and has also made me more motivated to become successful.<br><br>

         I currently attend the University of California, Riverside. I am a second year Pre-Business major with an intent on going into real estate. My grandmother, who has played a significant role in my life, is very familiar with the real estate world and would like me to follow in her footsteps and be able to learn from her and create my own real estate company. With that in mind, I have goals of getting my business degree from the University of California, Riverside while also eventually getting my real estate license. Once I am able to do this, I will devote much of my time learning and soaking up information from anyone and anything that can provide knowledge, including my grandmother. <br><br>

       Up to this point in my 20 years of life, I have gained experience working in retail, which I did for almost four years at Skechers. While I was there I was able to gain a sense of awareness on how to interact with customers and be an effective salesman. I learned how to work as a cashier and garnered a realization about the value of money. Working at Skechers as my first job has allowed me to learn many skills that I am able to take with me on my future path which I believe will be significant on whatever path I end up taking.I have experience working with children at summer camps. I also have been exposed to real estate my whole life with the amount of friends and family members around me who are deep in this field. Where I have been able to get insight on how to be an effective realtor while also branching off and learning how to start your own real estate business firm. Some facts to know about me is that I am fanatic about music as well as sports. I feel that both music and sports play a significant role in my life as they are great distractions and ways I am able to express myself. Especially through music because I genuinely feel that without music in this world, it would be much more quiet obviously but the world would be missing something and there would be an awkward silence. Some things that I would love to learn how to do as hobbies would be to learn more about cooking and potentially baking since I am a huge foody. I enjoy trying new things and being open minded to what the world has to offer. That’s just a small insight into who I am as an individual.
